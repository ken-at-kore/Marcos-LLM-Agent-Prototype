# Marco's LLM Agent Prototype

This prototype demonstrates a Marco's food ordering experience. This bot leverages the [OpenAI Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview), a stateful API for managing a GPT session. It uses [Steamlit](https://streamlit.io) for the UI and web server. Ken Grafals developed a Python LLM Agent orchestration framework that puts it all together.
